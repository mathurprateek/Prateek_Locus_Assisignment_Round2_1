Task: Propose a way to automatically check the predicted pressure between 06 AM and 06 PM, if pressure is predicted to fall below 995 Millibar, trigger a mail to the relevant stakeholder.
I propose to write a Python script to automate this task.
API: https://openweathermap.org/api >> "One Call API"
Service: Hourly forecast for 48 hours.
> User Input: Latitude and Longitude values
> Identify the timezone as per the Latitude and Longitude values.
> Evaluate the Unix timestamp for 06 am (start) and 06 pm (end) as per the timezone of coordinates.
> Schedule the script to run every day morning at 03 AM.
> Call the Hourly forecast for 48 hours service with GET method to fetch the forecast details for 48hours.
> Intercept the response from API.
> Check the elements in response for two conditions:
    1. Unix timestamp between 06 am and 06 pm of the respective day.
    2. Value of pressure below 995 Millibar.
> Store the Unix timestamp and pressure values received as key-value pair in a dictionary for the above qualifying criteria.
> If there are any records in the dictionary.
> Configure SMTP and SSL to send a secure mail to the stakeholders automatically.

Using this approach stakeholders will be automatically updated within a short span via the Alert mail for predicted low pressure.
